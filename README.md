## Compilation

The compilation can be done either using the provided
* **Makefile**: Linux/MacOS only 
* **CMakeLists.txt** using CMake (Linux/MacOS/Windows)


The library has one external dependency: [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) which can be installed through standard packages in Linux/MacOS (see the provided detailed tutorials).



* [Command lines to compile in Linux/MacOS](doc/compilation.md#command_line)
* **Detailed tutorials** to set up your system and compile on
  * [Linux/Ubuntu](doc/compilation.md#Ubuntu)
  * [MacOS](doc/compilation.md#MacOS)
  * [Windows](doc/visual_studio.md)
